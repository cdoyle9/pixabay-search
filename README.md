This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You will also need a .env file with the value `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` set to your [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) api key. You can get one for free simply by creating an account.
